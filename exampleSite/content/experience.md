I am a software developer with a passion for web development. I have a background in computer science and mathematics, and I have a strong interest in the intersection of technology and art. I am currently working as a software developer at [example org.](https://example.com) in San Francisco, CA.

I am currently working on a project that will be used to help people find the best way to get around the city.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- React
- Node
- Express
