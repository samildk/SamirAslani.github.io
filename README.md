A high performance and mobile first hugo template for personal portfolio and blog

## Requirements

- Hugo Version 0.68.0 or higher

## How to use this template

- [Hugo theme format](#Hugo-theme-format)
- [Local Development](#Local-Development)
- [Direct deployment using netlify](#Direct-deployment-using-netlify)
- [Direct deployment using Github Pages and action](#Direct-deployment-using-Github-Pages-and-action)

### Hugo theme format

- Install Hugo and create a site using `hugo new site my-site -f=yaml`
- Clone this repo inside your themes folder and create config.yaml (_I am not much aware about toml. So, I am using yaml format._) inside root folder and use one of these [v1config](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile/blob/version3/exampleSite/v1.yaml), [v2config](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile/blob/version3/exampleSite/v2.yaml), [v3config](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile/blob/version3/exampleSite/v3.yaml) as base template.

```
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile.git
```

- You should have the mentioned (_inside the config file_) images in static folder to use them.

### Local Development

- Install hugo and just clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile.git
cd hugo-profile
```

- Now create config.yaml file in your root folder and use one of these [v1config](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile/blob/version3/exampleSite/v1.yaml), [v2config](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile/blob/version3/exampleSite/v2.yaml), [v3config](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile/blob/version3/exampleSite/v3.yaml) as base template.
- Run your site using `hugo serve` commend

### Direct deployment using netlify

- Fork this repo or create new repo using `use this template` button and connect repo to netlify.
- You can customize the config file, content and everything inside exampleSite folder. Netlify will automatically deploy your changes every time you modify the repo.

**[What is netlify?](https://www.netlify.com/about/)** An intuitive Git-based workflow and powerful serverless platform to build, deploy, and collaborate on web apps

### Direct deployment using Github Pages and action

- Fork this repo or create new repo using `use this template` button. Github action will generate all files and push to demo branch. Now, you have to connect your github pages to that `demo` branch. _No need to create demo branch. Github action will take care of it_
- You can customize the config file, content and everything inside exampleSite folder. Github action will automatically deploy your changes to demo branch every time you modify the repo.
- When using your own domain create a file in the static dir called `CNAME' and put your domain in it.
- If you clone the repo locally, you can view the local change with `hugo  --gc --minify --themesDir . serve` from within the exampleSite dir.

## Deployment

Run `hugo`. It will generate a folder called public. You can use the files inside public folder for deployment. You should delete the public folder for each time when you are using `hugo` commend.
